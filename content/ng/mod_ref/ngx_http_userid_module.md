# Module ngx_http_userid_module

https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_userid_module.html



The `ngx_http_userid_module` module sets cookies suitable for client identification. Received and set cookies can be logged using the embedded variables [$uid_got]({{< ref "ng/mod_ref/ngx_http_userid_module#var_uid_got">}}) and [$uid_set]({{< ref "ng/mod_ref/ngx_http_userid_module#var_uid_set">}}). This module is compatible with the [mod_uid](http://www.lexa.ru/programs/mod-uid-eng.html) module for Apache.



## Example Configuration



```
userid         on;
userid_name    uid;
userid_domain  example.com;
userid_path    /;
userid_expires 365d;
userid_p3p     'policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID"';
```





## Directives



### userid

  Syntax:`userid on | v1 | log | off;`

  Default: `userid off;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Enables or disables setting cookies and logging the received cookies:

- `on`

  enables the setting of version 2 cookies and logging of the received cookies;

- `v1`

  enables the setting of version 1 cookies and logging of the received cookies;

- `log`

  disables the setting of cookies, but enables logging of the received cookies;

- `off`

  disables the setting of cookies and logging of the received cookies.





### userid_domain

  Syntax:`userid_domain name | none;`

  Default: `userid_domain none;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Defines a domain for which the cookie is set. The `none` parameter disables setting of a domain for the cookie.



### userid_expires

  Syntax:`userid_expires time | max | off;`

  Default: `userid_expires off;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Sets a time during which a browser should keep the cookie. The parameter `max` will cause the cookie to expire on “`31 Dec 2037 23:55:55 GMT`”. The parameter `off` will cause the cookie to expire at the end of a browser session.



### userid_flags

  Syntax:`userid_flags off | flag ...;`

  Default: `userid_flags off;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


This directive appeared in version 1.19.3.

If the parameter is not `off`, defines one or more additional flags for the cookie: `secure`, `httponly`, `samesite=strict`, `samesite=lax`, `samesite=none`.



### userid_mark

  Syntax:`userid_mark letter | digit | = | off;`

  Default: `userid_mark off;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


If the parameter is not `off`, enables the cookie marking mechanism and sets the character used as a mark. This mechanism is used to add or change [userid_p3p](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_userid_module.html#userid_p3p) and/or a cookie expiration time while preserving the client identifier. A mark can be any letter of the English alphabet (case-sensitive), digit, or the “`=`” character.

If the mark is set, it is compared with the first padding symbol in the base64 representation of the client identifier passed in a cookie. If they do not match, the cookie is resent with the specified mark, expiration time, and “P3P” header.



### userid_name

  Syntax:  `userid_name name;`

  Default: `userid_name uid;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Sets the cookie name.



### userid_p3p

  Syntax:  `userid_p3p string | none;`

  Default: `userid_p3p none;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Sets a value for the “P3P” header field that will be sent along with the cookie. If the directive is set to the special value `none`, the “P3P” header will not be sent in a response.



### userid_path

  Syntax:  `userid_path path;`

  Default: `userid_path /;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


Defines a path for which the cookie is set.



### userid_service

  Syntax:  `userid_service number;`

  Default: `userid_service IP address of the server;`

  Context: `http`, `server`, `location`


If identifiers are issued by multiple servers (services), each service should be assigned its own `number` to ensure that client identifiers are unique. For version 1 cookies, the default value is zero. For version 2 cookies, the default value is the number composed from the last four octets of the server’s IP address.



## Embedded Variables

The `ngx_http_userid_module` module supports the following embedded variables:

- `$uid_got`

  The cookie name and received client identifier.

- `$uid_reset`

  If the variable is set to a non-empty string that is not “`0`”, the client identifiers are reset. The special value “`log`” additionally leads to the output of messages about the reset identifiers to the [error_log]({{< ref "ng/mod_ref/ngx_core_module#error_log">}}).

- `$uid_set`

  The cookie name and sent client identifier.
