# Module ngx_stream_js_module

https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_js_module.html



The `ngx_stream_js_module` module is used to implement handlers in [njs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/index.html) — a subset of the JavaScript language.

Download and install instructions are available [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/install.html).



## Example Configuration

The example works since [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0).

```
stream {
    js_import stream.js;

    js_set $bar stream.bar;
    js_set $req_line stream.req_line;

    server {
        listen 12345;

        js_preread stream.preread;
        return     $req_line;
    }

    server {
        listen 12346;

        js_access  stream.access;
        proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:8000;
        js_filter  stream.header_inject;
    }
}

http {
    server {
        listen 8000;
        location / {
            return 200 $http_foo\n;
        }
    }
}
```



The `stream.js` file:

```
var line = '';

function bar(s) {
    var v = s.variables;
    s.log("hello from bar() handler!");
    return "bar-var" + v.remote_port + "; pid=" + v.pid;
}

function preread(s) {
    s.on('upload', function (data, flags) {
        var n = data.indexOf('\n');
        if (n != -1) {
            line = data.substr(0, n);
            s.done();
        }
    });
}

function req_line(s) {
    return line;
}

// Read HTTP request line.
// Collect bytes in 'req' until
// request line is read.
// Injects HTTP header into a client's request

var my_header =  'Foo: foo';
function header_inject(s) {
    var req = '';
    s.on('upload', function(data, flags) {
        req += data;
        var n = req.search('\n');
        if (n != -1) {
            var rest = req.substr(n + 1);
            req = req.substr(0, n + 1);
            s.send(req + my_header + '\r\n' + rest, flags);
            s.off('upload');
        }
    });
}

function access(s) {
    if (s.remoteAddress.match('^192.*')) {
        s.deny();
        return;
    }

    s.allow();
}

export default {bar, preread, req_line, header_inject, access};
```





## Directives



### js_access

  Syntax:`js_access function | module.function;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


Sets an njs function which will be called at the [access](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#access_phase) phase. Since [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0), a module function can be referenced.

The function is called once at the moment when the stream session reaches the [access](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#access_phase) phase for the first time. The function is called with the following arguments:

- `s`

  the [Stream Session](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#stream) object



At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization or register a callback with the [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) method for each incoming data chunk until one of the following methods are called: [`s.allow()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_allow), [`s.decline()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_decline), [`s.done()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_done). As soon as one of these methods is called, the stream session processing switches to the [next phase](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html) and all current [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) callbacks are dropped.



### js_fetch_buffer_size

  Syntax:`js_fetch_buffer_size size;`

  Default: `js_fetch_buffer_size 16k;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.4.

The full list can be viewed using the “`openssl ciphers`” command.



### js_fetch_max_response_buffer_size

  Syntax:`js_fetch_max_response_buffer_size size;`

  Default: `js_fetch_max_response_buffer_size 1m;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.4.

Sets the maximum `size` of the response received with [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch).



### js_fetch_protocols

  Syntax:`js_fetch_protocols [TLSv1] [TLSv1.1] [TLSv1.2] [TLSv1.3];`

  Default: `js_fetch_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.0.

Enables the specified protocols for HTTPS connections with [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch).



### js_fetch_timeout

  Syntax:`js_fetch_timeout time;`

  Default: `js_fetch_timeout 60s;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.4.

Defines a timeout for reading and writing for [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch). The timeout is set only between two successive read/write operations, not for the whole response. If no data is transmitted within this time, the connection is closed.



### js_fetch_trusted_certificate

  Syntax:`js_fetch_trusted_certificate file;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.0.

Specifies a `file` with trusted CA certificates in the PEM format used to [verify](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#fetch_verify) the HTTPS certificate with [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch).



### js_fetch_verify

  Syntax:`js_fetch_verify on | off;`

  Default: `js_fetch_verify on;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.4.

Enables or disables verification of the HTTPS server certificate with [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch).



### js_fetch_verify_depth

  Syntax:`js_fetch_verify_depth number;`

  Default: `js_fetch_verify_depth 100;`

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.0.

Sets the verification depth in the HTTPS server certificates chain with [Fetch API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch).



### js_filter

  Syntax:`js_filter function | module.function;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


Sets a data filter. Since [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0), a module function can be referenced. The filter function is called once at the moment when the stream session reaches the [content](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#content_phase) phase.

The filter function is called with the following arguments:

- `s`

  the [Stream Session](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#stream) object



At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization or register a callback with the [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) method for each incoming data chunk. The [`s.off()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_off) method may be used to unregister a callback and stop filtering.



As the `js_filter` handler returns its result immediately, it supports only synchronous operations. Thus, asynchronous operations such as [`ngx.fetch()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch) or [`setTimeout()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#settimeout) are not supported.





### js_import

  Syntax:`js_import module.js | export_name from module.js;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.4.0.

Imports a module that implements location and variable handlers in njs. The `export_name` is used as a namespace to access module functions. If the `export_name` is not specified, the module name will be used as a namespace.

```
js_import stream.js;
```

Here, the module name `stream` is used as a namespace while accessing exports. If the imported module exports `foo()`, `stream.foo` is used to refer to it.

Several `js_import` directives can be specified.



The directive can be specified on the `server` level since [0.7.7](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.7.7).





### js_include

  Syntax:`js_include file;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`


Specifies a file that implements server and variable handlers in njs:

```
nginx.conf:
js_include stream.js;
js_set     $js_addr address;
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:12345;
    return $js_addr;
}

stream.js:
function address(s) {
    return s.remoteAddress;
}
```



The directive was made obsolete in version [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0) and was removed in version [0.7.1](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.7.1). The [js_import](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_js_module.html#js_import) directive should be used instead.



### js_path

  Syntax:  `js_path path;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.3.0.

Sets an additional path for njs modules.



The directive can be specified on the `server` level since [0.7.7](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.7.7).





### js_preload_object

  Syntax:`js_preload_object name.json | name from file.json;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.7.8.

Preloads an immutable object at configure time. The `name` is used a name of the global variable though which the object is available in njs code. If the `name` is not specified, the file name will be used instead.

```
js_preload_object map.json;
```

Here, the `map` is used as a name while accessing the preloaded object.

Several `js_preload_object` directives can be specified.



### js_preread

  Syntax:`js_preread function | module.function;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


Sets an njs function which will be called at the [preread](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#preread_phase) phase. Since [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0), a module function can be referenced.

The function is called once at the moment when the stream session reaches the [preread](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#preread_phase) phase for the first time. The function is called with the following arguments:

- `s`

  the [Stream Session](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#stream) object



At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization or register a callback with the [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) method for each incoming data chunk until one of the following methods are called: [`s.allow()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_allow), [`s.decline()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_decline), [`s.done()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_done). When one of these methods is called, the stream session switches to the [next phase](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html) and all current [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) callbacks are dropped.



As the `js_preread` handler returns its result immediately, it supports only synchronous callbacks. Thus, asynchronous callbacks such as [`ngx.fetch()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch) or [`setTimeout()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#settimeout) are not supported. Nevertheless, asynchronous operations are supported in [`s.on()`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#s_on) callbacks in the [preread](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html#preread_phase) phase. See [this example](https://github.com/nginx/njs-examples#authorizing-connections-using-ngx-fetch-as-auth-request-stream-auth-request) for more information.





### js_set

  Syntax:`js_set $variable function | module.function;`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


Sets an njs `function` for the specified `variable`. Since [0.4.0](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.4.0), a module function can be referenced.

The function is called when the variable is referenced for the first time for a given request. The exact moment depends on a [phase](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/stream_processing.html) at which the variable is referenced. This can be used to perform some logic not related to variable evaluation. For example, if the variable is referenced only in the [log_format](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_log_module.html#log_format) directive, its handler will not be executed until the log phase. This handler can be used to do some cleanup right before the request is freed.



As the `js_set` handler returns its result immediately, it supports only synchronous callbacks. Thus, asynchronous callbacks such as [ngx.fetch()](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_fetch) or [setTimeout()](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#settimeout) are not supported.





The directive can be specified on the `server` level since [0.7.7](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.7.7).





### js_shared_dict_zone

  Syntax:`js_shared_dict_zone zone=name:size [timeout=time] [type=string|number] [evict];`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`


This directive appeared in version 0.8.0.

Sets the `name` and `size` of the shared memory zone that keeps the key-value dictionary shared between worker processes.

By default the shared dictionary uses a string as a key and a value. The optional `type` parameter allows redefining the value type to number.

The optional `timeout` parameter sets the time after which all shared dictionary entries are removed from the zone.

The optional `evict` parameter removes the oldest key-value pair when the zone storage is exhausted.

Examples:

```
example.conf:
    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values,
    # removes key-value pairs after 60 seconds of inactivity:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=foo:1M timeout=60s;

    # Creates a 512Kb dictionary with string values,
    # forcibly removes oldest key-value pairs when the zone is exhausted:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=bar:512K timeout=30s evict;

    # Creates a 32Kb permanent dictionary with number values:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=num:32k type=number;

example.js:
    function get(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.get(r.args.key));
    }

    function set(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.set(r.args.key, r.args.value));
    }

    function delete(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.bar.delete(r.args.key));
    }

    function increment(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.num.incr(r.args.key, 2));
    }
```





### js_var

  Syntax:`js_var $variable [value];`

  Default: —

  Context: `stream`, `server`


This directive appeared in version 0.5.3.

Declares a [writable](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#r_variables) variable. The value can contain text, variables, and their combination.



The directive can be specified on the `server` level since [0.7.7](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.7.7).





## Session Object Properties

Each stream njs handler receives one argument, a stream session [object](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#stream).
